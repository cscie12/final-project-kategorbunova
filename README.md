This website is designed as part of the assignment for Harvard Extention School, class CSCIE12 Fall 2023 semester. 

# "Step by Step‚Äù

## Purpose and goals of the site:
The goal of the website is to create a personal list of hiking trails: the ones I've already completed and the ones that are still on my list. The map widget will help put together the locations of both categories (visualized by color, which ones are complete). The website will also link all helpful information about those trails (e.g., national park website, AllTrails, directions on Google Maps). Once the hike is completed, the photos from the hike can be uploaded to the photo gallery, the marker on the map changed to "completed" and a short review/passage can be added about that hike.

## Audiences
Primary audience: Myself, to keep track of my past and future hikes. The past ones will be a good gallery to look back to, the future ones will serve as an organized list with all the links and locations, so I don't have to do research every time. 
Secondary audience: Family and friends. My family would be interested in seeing more about my experience (photos, personal notes, locations of those hikes) all easily aggregated in one place. My friends, who visit PNW, could be interested in recommendations and would also appreciate such a list. 

## Technology
HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (libraries: LeafletJS, Lightbox)
